    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, **file handling** refers to reading to and writing from files. In case you are not familiar with the concept of files or have never had to work with them before, a file is a container in a computer system for storing information. Files are organized in a hierarchical directory structure on a computer system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most operating systems provide a file system that allows you to create, read, write, and delete files and directories. Chances are, you have already worked with files before, even if you didn't realize it. For example, when you download a file from the internet, save a document, or take a picture on your phone, you are creating/modifying files.\n",
    "\n",
    "In another notebook, we discuss files and directories in more detail if you are curious or think it would help. For now, let's just accept that files exist, store information, and can be worked with via Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opening and Closing Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can read from or write to a file, you need to open it. Opening a file creates a connection between the file and your program, allowing you to read from or write to the file. When you are done working with the file, you should close it to release the resources associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening a File\n",
    "In Python, you can open a file using the built-in `open()` function. The `open()` function returns a file object, which provides methods and attributes for working with the file. The open function takes two arguments: \n",
    "- **filename**: the name (and path) of the file to open as a string\n",
    "- **mode**: the mode in which to open the file (e.g., read, write,  append, etc.) as a string\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides several modes for opening a file. The most common modes are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `'r'`: Open a file for reading. (default)\n",
    "- `'w'`: Open a file for writing. Creates a new file if it does not exist or truncates the file if it exists.\n",
    "- `'x'`: Open a file for exclusive creation. If the file already exists, the operation fails.\n",
    "- `'a'`: Open for appending at the end of the file without truncating it. Creates a new file if it does not exist.\n",
    "- `'rb'`/`'wb'`/`'ab'`: Open in binary mode (read/write/append). This is used for non-text files like images or executable files.\n",
    "- `'r+'`: Open a file for reading and writing (file must exist).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of opening a file in read mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Closing a File\n",
    "When you are done working with a file, you should close it using the `close()` method of the file object. Closing a file releases the resources associated with the file and ensures that the file is saved to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```"

    "## Writing to a File\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know how to open and close files, let's see how to write to a file. \n",
    "\n",
    "To write to a file in Python, we first open the file in either write mode (`'w'`) or append mode (`'a'`). Then, we can write to the file using the `write()` method of the file object. The `write()` method writes a string to the file. If you want to write something other than a string (e.g., a number), you will need to convert it to a string first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of writing to a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'w')\n",
    "file.write('Hello, World!')\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we open a file named `example.txt` in write mode, write the string `'Hello, World!'` to the file, and then close the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the file does not exist, it will be created. If the file already exists, it will be truncated (i.e., cleared) before writing to it when opened in write mode. If you want to append to the file without truncating it, you can open the file in append mode (`'a'`).\n",

    "##Reading from Files\n",
    "\n",
    "To read from an existing file in Python, you can open the file in read mode (`'r'`) and then use one of the following methods to read from the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `read()`: Reads the entire file and returns its contents as a single string.\n",
    "- `readline()`: Reads a single line from the file at a time.\n",
    "- `readlines()`: Reads all the lines from the file and returns them as a list of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example using `read()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "content = file.read()\n",
    "print(content)\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example using `readline()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "line = file.readline()\n",
    "print(line) \n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example using `readlines()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file = open('example.txt', 'r')\n",
    "lines = file.readlines()  # Reads all lines into a list\n",
    "for line in lines:\n",
    "    print(line, end='')\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The preferred method for reading from a file depends on the size of the file and the task you are trying to accomplish. If you are working with a small file and need to process the entire file at once, you can use `read()`. If you are working with a large file or need to process the file line by line, you can use `readline()` or `readlines()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a better way to read from files in Python using the `with` statement. The `with` statement creates a context manager that automatically closes the file for you when you are done working with it. Here is an example of reading from a file using the `with` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
