    "# Introduction\n",
    "Probably one of the most important skills a programmer can have, is organization. Git/GitHub are two tools which are used extensively across the software industry and essentially help you organize and keep track of code versions, code history, and who has done what in a piece of software.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Git?\n",
    "Git is technically the nuts-and-bolts of the version control system that allows you to track changes in your code, collaborate with others, and revert to previous versions when needed. It is the set of tools that helps teams work efficiently by managing different versions of a project.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Git?\n",
    "- **Track Changes**: Git allows you to track changes in your codebase, so you can see what changes were made, who made them, and when they were made.\n",
    "- **Collaborate**: Git allows multiple developers to work on the same project at the same time. It helps you avoid conflicts and merge changes from different developers.\n",
    "- **Revert Changes**: Git allows you to revert to a previous version of your codebase if something goes wrong.\n",
    "- **Branching/Merging**: Git allows you to create branches to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase. You can merge changes from different branches when they are ready.\n",
    "- **Open Source**: Git is open-source, so you can use it for free and contribute to the community.\n",
    "- **Backup**: Git allows you to store your codebase on a remote server, so you have a backup in case your local copy is lost or corrupted.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is GitHub?\n",
    "GitHub is a cloud-based platform that uses Git for version control. It allows developers to store their projects, collaborate with others, and contribute to open-source projects. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features \n",
    "- **Remote Repository**: GitHub allows you to store your codebase on a remote server- you can access your code from anywhere and you have a backup in case your local copy is  lost or corrupted.\n",
    "- **Pull Requests**: GitHub allows you to create pull requests to propose changes to a project. Other developers can review your changes and merge them into the main codebase.\n",
    "- **Issues**: GitHub allows you to create issues to track bugs, feature requests, and other tasks. You can assign issues to developers, set deadlines, and track progress.\n",
    "- **Actions**: GitHub allows you to automate your workflow with GitHub Actions. You can create custom workflows to build, test, and deploy your codebase.\n",
    "\n",

    "# 0. Making a GitHub Account\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start using Git and GitHub, you need to create a GitHub account. Go to [GitHub](https//github.com) and sign up for a free account. Once you have created an account, you can start using Git and GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. Installing Git\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Git on your local machine, you need to install Git. Here are the steps to install Git on your machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows\n",
    "1. Download the latest version of Git from the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com).\n",
    "2. Run the installer and follow the instructions.\n",
    "3. Make sure to enable the option to use Git from the Windows Command Prompt. This will allow you to use Git from the Command Prompt or Git Bash.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mac\n",
    "0. You could use the same method as windows, but I would recommend using Homebrew to install Git.\n",
    "1. Open the Terminal application.\n",
    "2. Use the following command to install Git using Homebrew:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "brew install git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linux\n",
    "1. Use the package manager to install Git. For example, on Ubuntu/Debian, you can run the following command:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "sudo apt-get update\n",
    "sudo apt-get install git\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Open the Terminal application to start using Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Setting Up Git\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing Git, you need to set up your Git username and email address. Here are the steps to set up Git:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the Git Bash or Terminal application.\n",
    "2. Run the following commands to set up your Git username and email address:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n",
    "git config --global user.email \"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. Verifying Git Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To verify that Git is installed correctly, you can run the following command in the Command Prompt, Git Bash, or Terminal:\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "git --version\n",
    "```\n",

    "# Version Control with Git\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Version Control?\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control is a system that allows you to track and manage changes to files, most often in the context of software development. It enables multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other’s work, and it provides a historical record of changes to files, making it easy to revert back to previous versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take game development as an example. Over time, games evolve - new maps/entities are added, stats are balanced, and hardware specs change. Regardless of the size of the game or how good the developers are, bugs will appear and things will go wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Version control is like a time machine for your game code. It allows you to save snapshots of your game’s code at different stages. You can roll back to a previous version of the game if a new update breaks something, or you can track changes to understand what caused a bug or issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts and Vocab:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Repository (Repo)**: A Repo is the container for a specific project. This project could be a piece of software, a video game, or a tutorial like this one! It holds all the files, history, and documentation related to your game or software. If your repo were a video game, it would be the current state of the game, all the previous versions, and would contain all future updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Commit**: Commits are snapshots of your code at a specific point in time. They are save points in your code. You can think of them as a checkpoint in a video game. If you make a mistake, you can go back to the last checkpoint and try again.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Branch**: A branch is a parallel version of your code. It allows you to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main codebase.\n",
    "    - **Main Branch**: The main branch is the default branch in a Git repository. It is the main line of development and is often called `master` or `main`. If your repo were a video game, the main branch would be the current version of the game that players are playing.\n",
    "    - **Feature Branch**: A feature branch is a branch that is created to work on a new feature or bug fix. It allows you to work on the feature without affecting the main codebase. These branches would be like a beta version, or a new feature that is being tested before being added to the main game.\n",
    "    - **Hotfix Branch**: A hotfix branch is a branch that is created to fix a critical bug in the main codebase. It allows you to fix the bug quickly without affecting the main codebase. These branches would be like a patch that is released to fix a game-breaking bug.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Merge**: Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another branch. It allows you to bring the changes from a feature branch into the main codebase. This could be done with any of the previous branches we mentioned to update another branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rebase**: Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. It allows you to rewrite the commit history of a branch. This is useful for cleaning up your commit history before merging changes into the main codebase. If you were working on a new update that added both map changes and character changes, you could rebase both of those changes into a single commit before merging them into the \"new update\" branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Staging Area (Index)**: The staging area is a place where you can prepare your changes before committing them. It allows you to review your changes and make sure you are only committing the changes you want. If you were working on a new update that added both map changes and character changes, you could stage the map changes first and then stage the character changes before committing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Remote Repository**: A remote repository is a repository that is hosted on a remote server. It allows you to store your codebase on a remote server and collaborate with other developers. If your repo were a video game, the remote repository would be a cloud save of your game that you can access from anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local Repository**: A local repository is a repository that is stored on your local machine. This is the place that you actually work on your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fork**: A fork is a copy of a repository that is stored in your GitHub account. It allows you to work on the repository without affecting the original repository. If you were working on a new update for a game, you could fork the game repository to work on the update without affecting the main game. This is similar to making a new branch, but instead of being stored in the remote repository, it is stored in your GitHub account.\n",
