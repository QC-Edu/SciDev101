    "## Syntax \n",
    "\n",
    "As previously mentioned, one of the key features of Python is its readability. Python code is written in a very clean and intuitive way. Syntax refers to the structure of the language (i.e. the rules that define how the language is written). This section will cover some of the basic syntax rules of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments\n",
    "Comments are used to explain the code and make it more readable. They are ignored by the Python interpreter- in other words - they are notes for yourself (and most importantly others) and are *IGNORED* by the computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of comments in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single-line comments: These comments are written using the `#` symbol. Any text written after the `#` symbol is considered a comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multi-line comments: These comments are written using triple quotes `'''` or `\"\"\"`. Any text written between these triple quotes is considered a comment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# This is a single-line comment\n",
    "\n",
    "'''         \n",
    "This is a multi-line comment\n",
    "This is a multi-line comment\n",
    "This is a multi-line comment\n",
    "'''\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "This is also a multi-line comment\n",
    "using double quotes\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses indentation to define code blocks. Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. This is much like how paragraphs or outlines are indented in English.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",

    "## Variables and Constants\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "*Variable* is the name given to a memory location to store a value. We can create a variable by assigning a value to it using the `=` operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python   \n",
    "year = 2025 #Integer variable\n",
    "name = \"John\" #String variable\n",
    "time = 4.5 #Float variable\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python is a dynamically typed language, meaning you don't have to declare the type of a variable when you create one. Python automatically assigns the data type based on the value you assign to the variable. Soon we will discuss the various data types in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Naming Conventions/Rules for Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are pretty much the only make-or-break rules for naming variables in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Variable names are case-sensitive (i.e. `name` and `Name` are two different variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore `_`. i.e. no numbers or special characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. *Spaces are not allowed.*\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Variable names cannot be a reserved keyword in Python. For example, you cannot name a variable `if` or `for` as they are reserved keywords in Python. You can see a list of reserved keywords in Python [here](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are conventions for naming variables in Python - this is more of a \"Do as I say, not as I do\" situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful. For example, `name` is a better variable name than `n`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Variable names should be written in lowercase with underscores separating words. For example, `first_name` is a better variable name than `firstName`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) If a variable name is long, you can use camel case. For example, `northWestPolytechnic` is a better variable name than `north_west_polytechnic`, but you would be better off using `nwp` or `nw_poly` etc. instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* The value stored in a variable can be changed during program execution. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constants\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other languages, Python does not have a built-in constant type. Generally, we use all capital letters to define a constant in Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "PI = 3.14\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alas, Python will allow you to change this value of `PI` - but that would eliminate the point of it being a constant in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## Basic Data Types of Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports a variety of data types. Understanding each of these will help you select the appropriate type (or structure) to hold (or modify) the data you need to work with. Each comes with its own set of operations, methods, caveats, and best use cases. However, often times it is up to you, the programmer, to decide which data type you prefer to use since many of them can be used interchangeably - *not optimally, but interchangeably*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Python supports three types of numeric data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Integer: These are whole numbers (positive or negative) without a decimal point. For example, `5`, `-3`, `0`, `1000`, etc.   \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Float: These are numbers with a decimal point or numbers written in scientific notation. For example, `3.14`, `2.0`, `1e-9`, etc.    \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Complex: These are numbers written in the form `a+bj`, where `a` is the real part and `b` is the imaginary part. For example, `3+4j`, `1-2j`, etc. These are not used as frequently as integers and floats in general programming. Usually when you need to work with complex numbers, you will be using a library that supports complex numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Aside:* Python has built-in support for arbitrary precision integers. This means that you can work with integers of any size and not be limited by the size of the computer's memory. This is not the case with floats, which are limited by the computer's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* At any point in time, you can always check the data type of a variable using the `type()` function.\n"
