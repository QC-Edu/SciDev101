    "# Intro to Scientific Computing with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore two of the most important libraries in Python for scientific computing: NumPy and Matplotlib. \n",
    "\n",
    "## NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is the fundamental scientific computing package in Python. It is a Python library that provides support for large multidimensional arrays and matrices along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ndarray (N-dimensional array)**: NumPy's core data structure, providing fast and memory-efficient arrays.\n",
    "- **Mathematical Functions**: Operations on arrays (element-wise), linear algebra, statistics, and more.\n",
    "- **Broadcasting**: A powerful mechanism that allows NumPy to work with arrays of different shapes when performing arithmetic operations.\n",
    "- **Vectorization**: Expressing operations as occurring on entire arrays rather than their individual elements, leading to faster execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is included in the Anaconda distribution, so you don't need to install it separately. If you are using a different Python distribution, you can install NumPy using pip:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install numpy\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is then ready to use just like any other Python library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with NumPy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy's primary data structure is the `ndarray`, which is a multidimensional array of fixed-size items. With NumPy, it is easy to perform mathematical operations on arrays, making it a powerful tool for scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a NumPy array, you can use the `np.array()` function. Let's create a simple 1D array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a 1D NumPy array\n",
    "arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    "print(arr)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Create a 2D NumPy array\n",
    "arr2 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n",
    "print(arr2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Within NumPy, several helper functions are available to create arrays in specific patterns:\n",
    "- `np.zeros()`: Create an array of zeros.\n",
    "- `np.ones()`: Create an array of ones.\n",
    "- `np.arange()`: Create an array with a range of values.\n",
    "- `np.linspace()`: Create an array with a specified number of elements, evenly spaced between two values.\n",
    "- `np.random.rand()`: Create an array of random values between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these functions has several parameters that allow you to customize the output array as needed. A full list of functions and their parameters can be found in the [NumPy documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Creating an array of zeros\n",
    "zeros_arr = np.zeros((3, 4))\n",
    "print(\"Zeros Array:\\n\", zeros_arr)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an array of ones\n",
    "ones_arr = np.ones((2, 3))\n",
    "print(\"Ones Array:\\n\", ones_arr)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an array with a range of values\n",
    "range_arr = np.arange(10, 20, 2)\n",
    "print(\"Range Array:\", range_arr)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating an array of linearly spaced values\n",
    "linspace_arr = np.linspace(0, 1, 5)\n",
    "print(\"Linspace Array:\", linspace_arr)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Array Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical functions that can be applied to arrays. These functions can be used to perform operations on arrays, such as element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Element-wise Operations**\n",
    "```python   \n",
    "arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Element-wise addition\n",
    "print(\"Addition:\", arr1 + arr2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Element-wise multiplication\n",
    "print(\"Multiplication:\", arr1 * arr2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematical Functions**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Applying square root element-wise\n",
    "sqrt_arr = np.sqrt(arr1)\n",
    "print(\"Square root:\", sqrt_arr)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Applying sine function element-wise\n",
    "sin_arr = np.sin(arr1)\n",
    "print(\"Sine of elements:\", sin_arr)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Universal Functions (ufuncs)**\n",
    "NumPy has built-in universal functions (ufuncs) that allow you to perform operations on arrays, like calculating the sum or product across dimensions, or applying a custom function to each element.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Sum of all elements\n",
    "total_sum = np.sum(arr1)\n",
    "print(\"Sum of Elements:\", total_sum)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sum along axis 0 (columns for a 2D array)\n",
    "arr2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n",
    "sum_cols = np.sum(arr2d, axis=0)\n",
    "print(\"Sum Along Columns:\\n\", sum_cols)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Product of all elements\n",
    "prod_total = np.prod(arr2d)\n",
    "print(\"Product of Elements:\", prod_total)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Array Indexing and Slicing**\n",
    "NumPy arrays can be indexed and sliced just like Python Lists.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "arr = np.array([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accessing the first element\n",
    "print(\"First element:\", arr[0])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Slicing a subarray\n",
    "print(\"Sliced array:\", arr[1:4])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Boolean indexing to select elements greater than 30\n",
    "print(\"Elements greater than 30:\", arr[arr > 30])\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Broadcasting**\n",
    "Broadcasting is a powerful mechanism that allows NumPy to work with arrays of different shapes when performing arithmetic operations.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#Broadcasting with a scalar value\n",
    "arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "result = arr + 10\n",
    "print(\"Broadcasting with scalar:\", result)\n",
    "\n",
    "#Broadcasting with Two Arrays\n",
    "arr1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n",
    "arr2 = np.array([10, 20, 30])\n",
    "result = arr1 + arr2\n",
    "print(\"Broadcasting with two arrays:\\n\", result)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear Algebra Operations**\n",
    "NumPy provides a wide range of linear algebra functions, such as matrix multiplication, matrix inversion, eigenvalues, and more.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Matrix Multiplication\n",
    "mat1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "mat2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])\n",
    "mat_prod = np.dot(mat1, mat2)\n",
    "print(\"Matrix Multiplication:\\n\", mat_prod)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Matrix Inversion\n",
    "mat_inv = np.linalg.inv(mat1)\n",
    "print(\"Matrix Inversion:\\n\", mat_inv)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Reshaping Arrays**\n",
    "You can change the shape of an array using the `reshape()` function. This can be useful when you want to change a 1D array into a 2D array or vice versa.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reshape the 1D array into a 3x3 2D array\n",
    "reshaped_arr = arr.reshape(3, 3)\n",
    "print(\"Reshaped Array:\\n\", reshaped_arr)\n",
    "# Output:\n",
    "# [[1 2 3]\n",
    "#  [4 5 6]\n",
    "#  [7 8 9]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, NumPy provides several other functions for array manipulation, such as `flatten()`, `ravel()`, `transpose()`, `stack()`, `split()`, and more. These functions allow you to perform a wide range of operations on arrays, such as flattening, transposing, stacking, and splitting arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding NumPy Axes\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of axes is important when working with NumPy arrays. Many operations in NumPy allow you to specify an axis along which the operation should be performed. Axes can take a little time to get used to, but they are essential for working with multi-dimensional arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In Numpy, Axes are numbered starting from 0 as follows:\n",
    "- **1D array**: Axis 0\n",
    "- **2D array**: Axis 0 (rows), Axis 1 (columns)\n",
    "- **3D array**: Axis 0 (depth), Axis 1 (rows), Axis 2 (columns)\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept is essential when you are working with multi-dimensional arrays and performing operations like sum, mean, etc., along a specific axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Array Shape and Axes\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Shape** of an array tells you the number of elements along each axis. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A 1D array with 5 elements has a shape of (5,)\n",
    "- A 2D array with 2 rows and 3 columns has a shape of (2, 3)\n",
    "- A 3D array with 2 depth, 3 rows, and 4 columns has a shape of (2, 3, 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Shape** of an array can be accessed using the `shape` attribute of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n",
    "print(\"Shape of the array:\", arr.shape)\n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",

    "# Data Visualization with Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. It is built on NumPy arrays and designed to work with the broader SciPy stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simple and Consistent API**: Matplotlib has a simple and consistent API that makes it easy to create a wide range of plots.\n",
    "- **Customizable**: You can customize every aspect of a plot, including colors, labels, fonts, and more.\n",
    "- **Wide Range of Plots**: Matplotlib supports a wide range of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, pie charts, and more.\n",
    "- **Publication Quality**: Matplotlib produces high-quality plots that are suitable for publication.\n",
