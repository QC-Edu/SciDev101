## Create a working repository and branch
1. Fork the repository by clicking on the `Fork` button in the top-right corner. This creates a new copy of this repo under your GitHub user account.
2. Clone the repo using git clone  using this link: https://github.com/QC-Edu/SciDev101.git

Once the repo is cloned, you need to do two things:
1. Create a new branch by issuing the command: `git checkout -b new_branch`
2. Create a new remote for the upstream repo with the command: `git remote add upstream https://github.com/QC-Edu/SciDev101.git`

In this case, "upstream repo" refers to the original repo you created your fork from. Also you can take a look at  "Workflow summary" section [here](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/git-setup-remote)

Now, you can make changes to the file(s) you want to change.

##  Make a pull request
When you've finished your changes, add, commit and push them using `git add`, `git commit` and `git push -u origin new_branch` commands respectively.

Once you push the changes to your repo, find and click `Compare & pull request` button at your GitHub repo.

Open a pull request by clicking the `Create pull request button`. This allows us to review your contribution.
